# Sliding Puzzle- Neumorphism

>> A sliding puzzle, sliding block puzzle, or sliding tile puzzle is a combination puzzle that challenges a player to slide (frequently flat) pieces along certain routes (usually on a board) to establish a certain end-configuration.
 
The pieces to be moved may consist of simple shapes, or they may be imprinted with colours, patterns, sections of a larger picture (like a jigsaw puzzle), numbers, or letters.

Sliding puzzles are essentially two-dimensional in nature, even if the sliding is facilitated by mechanically interlinked pieces (like partially encaged marbles) or three-dimensional tokens. In manufactured wood and plastic products, the linking and encaging is often achieved in combination, through mortise-and-tenon key channels along the edges of the pieces. In at least one vintage case of the popular Chinese cognate game Huarong Road, a wire screen prevents lifting of the pieces, which remain loose. As the illustration shows, some sliding puzzles are mechanical puzzles. However, the mechanical fixtures are usually not essential to these puzzles; the parts could as well be tokens on a flat board that are moved according to certain rules.

## Solution:

<Table>
        <tr>
            <th>1</th>
        <th>2</th>
        <th>3</th>
        <th>4</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>8</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>9</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>11</td>
        <td>12</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>13</td>
        <td>14</td>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>16</td>
        </tr>
</Table>
