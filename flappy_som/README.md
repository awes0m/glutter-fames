# Flappy Som üê•

The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.

#### Physics
 - accleration: gravitational accleration(g) = 9.8 m/s^2
 - velocity: initial velocity(v) = 5 m/s
 - initial position: initial position(x) = 0 m
 - height= -g*t^2/2 + v*t + initial position/height=-4.9*t^2+ 5*t + 0
